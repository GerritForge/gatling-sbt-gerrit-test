Ctrl^C.\n\nWhen running `make parallel-run`, it is more involved: One would need to find all running containers with a docker query first.\nThis might take time and the execution might go on for much longer than actually wanted.\n\nI think a `make stop` would be useful.\n\nThis could be done as a follow up change.\n\nWDYT?",
