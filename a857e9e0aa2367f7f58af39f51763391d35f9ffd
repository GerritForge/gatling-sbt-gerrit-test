      "message": "This API is non-obvious now, we create a change for each hashtag, so we can create multiple changes, and yet this method is called `createChange` (singular). Also worth noting that if no hashtags are passed, no changes are created - this differs to what we had previously. Should we have another method to create a change per hashtag? Or alternatively let the caller do this?\n\nI think this method is doing a little too much.",
