      "message": "That\u0027s a good point - normally true for unimplemented members (or if we rely on any), which I didn\u0027t think was the case here. I\u0027m pretty sure we only want to evaluate this once only - in which case maybe a `lazy val` is safer? So if we were to override it the subclass would then not be allowed to use a `def`, but that\u0027s ok I think. In this case we don\u0027t _actually_ run anything, we just prepare the scenario, which then gets run later.\n\nAnyway not a biggie as I believe in practice this only gets called once per scenario anyway.",
