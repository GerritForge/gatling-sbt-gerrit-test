      "message": "Yes, a bit confusing. So, receive-pack are pushes, clones are upload-packs, so that was mistaken to begin with.\n\nFurthermore, the previous clone scenario did a bunch of set-up that we already do in CloneCommand.\n\nSo the correct way of doing this was to re-use the CloneCommand as cloneScenario, and remove the incorrect receivePack scenario as well as the needless set-up it was doing.",
