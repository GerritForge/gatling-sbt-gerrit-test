      "message": "I actually thought about that as well. However, I opted against it for 2 reasons:\n1. The config is generally for settings applicable for _all_ the tests, not just one scenario. For example, you have things like number of users, test duration, tokens etc. It will be awkward to have a setting just for one test. \n2. All the PAUSE variables are not in config, so they are read in the same way as I do here.",
