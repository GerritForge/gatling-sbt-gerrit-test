The main downfall is that we\u0027re forcing the user to always run the http simulation if they want to test bitbucket.\n\nI could add a bitbucket specific config that is the same value, this way one can only run the SSH simulation, but not the HTTP one.\n\nHowever, didn\u0027t think it was a particularly clean solution, so open to suggestions.",
